# OBIS data quality task team

## Motivation and scope

Data quality is important for any downstream users of the biodiversity data in the OBIS network. It can have significant impacts on the ease at which data from different sources can be re-used and the conclusions that can be drawn. Thus, ensuring the best quality data is a major concern for any OBIS node. To that aim, this task team was set up to further develop a common framework for the assessment and management of the quality of data submitted to OBIS. 

The scope of this task team includes:

- Quality control (QC) criteria 
- Align QC criteria with other data stakeholders/standards including:
	- IODE (use of IODE primary flags)
	- GBIF
	- TDWG (Darwin Core)
- Presentation of QC results to user (flags, interpreted values)

## Goals and outcomes

The task team aims to: 

- Establish a set of common QC criteria for OBIS data
- Provide solutions/recommendations to data quality related issues

The measures of success include:

- Reduced data quality flags across OBIS nodes
- Resolved data quality related issues in relevant OBIS GitHub repositories
